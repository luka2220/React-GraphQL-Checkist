## Technologies
This application was built with React, GraphQL, Apollo, and Hasura.
My purpose and goal were to develop a better understanding of building CRUD applications with React.

## Running the application
The app is not hosted anywhere so to run it:
  - download the project
  - cd into the project directory
  - run npm i (if not working install node)
  - run npm start (vist localhost:3000 in browser)
